# PRD: ModelVarianceAndESSOnMoreParams.py

## 1. Objective

To reinforce the concept of the inverse relationship between Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) and R-squared (R²) in a scenario with a significant number of parameters and a higher level of random noise. This script also emphasizes the realistic nature of having a unique, random error for each observation.

## 2. Requirements

*   **Language**: Python 3
*   **Libraries**:
    *   `numpy`
    *   `scikit-learn`
    *   `pandas`
    *   `matplotlib`
*   **Input Data**: None. The script generates its own synthetic data.

## 3. Process

1.  **Data Generation**:
    *   A synthetic dataset is created with 200 observations and 70 predictor variables.
    *   A key feature of this script is the generation of a unique random error (`epsilon_i`) for **each** of the 200 observations, drawn from a normal distribution with a high standard deviation (sigma = 8.0). This simulates a more realistic, noisy dataset.
    *   True `beta` parameters are generated, and the target variable `y` is created by combining the linear model, true parameters, and the unique error term for each observation.
2.  **Model Fitting**:
    *   A `LinearRegression` model is fitted to the generated data.
3.  **Metrics Calculation**:
    *   The model calculates predicted values (`y_hat`).
    *   The script explicitly shows the difference between the true random error (`epsilon_i`) and the model's residual (`e_i = y_i - y_hat_i`) for each observation.
    *   **SSE**, **SST**, and **R-squared** are calculated.
4.  **Simulation**:
    *   A simulation is run by generating 40 different models, each with a different level of noise, to map the relationship between SSE and R² across a range of error levels.
5.  **Visualization**:
    *   The script produces plots for **Actual vs. Predicted** values, a **Residual Plot**, and a scatter plot of **SSE vs. R²** to visually confirm their inverse relationship.

## 4. Output

*   **Console Output**:
    *   Details of the data generation, emphasizing the unique error for each observation.
    *   A comparison table showing `y_i`, `y_hat_i`, the true error `epsilon_i`, and the residual `e_i` for the first 10 observations.
    *   Calculated SSE, SST, and R² values.
    *   A summary table of the key metrics.
*   **Visualizations**:
    *   Standard regression diagnostic plots (Actual vs. Predicted, Residuals).
    *   A scatter plot of **SSE vs. R²**, colored by the noise level, which serves as the primary visualization to confirm the inverse relationship.

## 5. Key Demonstrated Concept

This script reinforces the findings of `ModelVarianceAndESS.py` but in a more complex and realistic setting. It highlights that even when every single data point has its own irreducible random error, the fundamental inverse relationship between the model's aggregate error (SSE) and its explanatory power (R²) holds true. It demonstrates that in a noisy, high-dimensional setting, a good model will still have a significant SSE and an R² value realistically below 1.0.
